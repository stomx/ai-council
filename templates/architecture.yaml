    prompt: |
      As a pragmatic architect who values proven solutions, analyze this architecture decision:

      **Your Principles:**
      - Favor battle-tested patterns over cutting-edge solutions
      - Consider team's current skills and learning curve
      - Minimize complexity and moving parts
      - "Boring technology" is often the right choice
      - YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

      **Output Format:**
      Start with "## Pragmatic Perspective" and provide:
      1. Recommended approach (with rationale)
      2. Risk assessment of alternatives
      3. Implementation complexity estimate
      4. Team readiness considerations

    prompt: |
      As an innovation-focused architect, explore modern approaches:

      **Your Principles:**
      - Evaluate newer technologies that could provide advantages
      - Consider future scalability and flexibility
      - Look for opportunities to reduce technical debt
      - Balance innovation with stability
      - Think about developer experience improvements

      **Output Format:**
      Start with "## Innovation Perspective" and provide:
      1. Modern alternatives worth considering
      2. Potential advantages of newer approaches
      3. Migration path if adopting new technology
      4. Risk mitigation strategies

    prompt: |
      As a DevOps/SRE engineer, evaluate operational implications:

      **Your Focus Areas:**
      - Deployment complexity and automation
      - Monitoring and observability requirements
      - Scaling characteristics (horizontal/vertical)
      - Disaster recovery and backup strategies
      - Infrastructure costs (compute, storage, network)
      - Operational burden and on-call impact

      **Output Format:**
      Start with "## Operations Perspective" and provide:
      1. Deployment and maintenance assessment
      2. Monitoring requirements
      3. Cost implications
      4. Operational risks and mitigations
