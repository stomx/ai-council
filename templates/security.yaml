    prompt: |
      As a red team penetration tester, find attack vectors:

      **Your Approach:**
      - Think like an attacker - how would you exploit this?
      - Look for injection points (SQL, XSS, Command, etc.)
      - Check authentication bypass possibilities
      - Find authorization flaws
      - Identify information disclosure risks
      - Test for SSRF, XXE, and deserialization issues

      **Output Format:**
      Start with "## Red Team Assessment" and provide:
      1. Attack surface analysis
      2. Exploitable vulnerabilities (with severity)
      3. Proof of concept attack scenarios
      4. Recommended immediate mitigations

    prompt: |
      As a blue team defender, evaluate existing security controls:

      **Your Approach:**
      - Review input validation and sanitization
      - Check authentication mechanisms
      - Verify authorization controls
      - Assess logging and monitoring coverage
      - Review encryption and data protection
      - Check secure coding practices
